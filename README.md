## Overview

This is a **60-minute live AI-assisted coding evaluation** designed to assess a developer's ability to work effectively with AI tools like GitHub Copilot or similar assistants. Candidates **must actively use an AI coding assistant** throughout the test to demonstrate both technical proficiency and AI collaboration skills.

The evaluation focuses on practical problem-solving, clean code architecture, and the ability to leverage AI tools efficiently while maintaining code quality and correctness.

### Candidate Choice

You have the **flexibility to choose** what you want to work on:
- **Backend Only** - Implement only the backend API requirements
- **Frontend Only** - Implement only the frontend UI requirements
- **Full-Stack (Both)** - Implement both backend and frontend (recommended for full-stack positions)

Choose based on your role, expertise, and comfort level. Make your choice clear at the start of the evaluation.

### Important Notes
⚠️ **Additional requirements will be provided at the 30-minute and 45-minute marks.** Be prepared to adapt and incorporate new requirements into your existing implementation.

## Main Task (MANDATORY)

### Objective
Build a **Task Management Feature** based on your chosen track (Backend, Frontend, or Full-Stack).

⚠️ **Note:** Detailed requirements will be explained verbally by the invigilator at the start of the test. Listen carefully and ask clarifying questions if needed.

### High-Level Requirements

**Backend Track:**
- Implement a RESTful API for task management
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- In-memory data storage (no database)
- Input validation and error handling
- Follow proper REST conventions

**Frontend Track:**
- Build a task management user interface
- Forms for creating/editing tasks
- List view with task display
- Status management functionality
- **Connect to the provided Mock API** (see ./mock-api/README.md)
- Use Angular services for data handling with HttpClient
- Error handling and user feedback
- Handle async operations (loading states)

**Full-Stack Track:**
- Complete both Backend and Frontend requirements
- Integrate frontend with backend API
- End-to-end functionality

### Additional Information
- Task structure and specific field requirements will be provided verbally
- API endpoint specifications will be explained during the test
- Business logic rules and validation requirements will be communicated by the invigilator
- **Remember:** Additional requirements will be given at 30 and 45-minute marks

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Start

Choose your track and follow the setup instructions in the respective folder:

- **Backend Only** → See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)
- **Frontend Only** → See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) + [mock-api/README.md](mock-api/README.md)
- **Full-Stack** → See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) + [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Angular CLI (for frontend: `npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- GitHub Copilot or similar AI assistant enabled

### Installation Summary

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
   ```

2. Navigate to your chosen folder(s)
3. Run `npm install` in each folder
4. For backend: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
5. Follow the specific README instructions

## AI Usage Guidelines

### Required AI Interaction

Candidates **must**:
- Use AI actively throughout the coding process
- Ask AI for planning and architecture suggestions before implementing
- Use AI to generate boilerplate code and speed up development
- Verify and validate AI-generated code
- Refactor AI suggestions when necessary

---

## Submission Instructions

After completing the test within 60 minutes:

### 1. Push Your Code
- Create a **new public GitHub repository**
- Push your complete solution including:
  - `backend/` folder (if you chose Backend or Full-Stack)
  - `frontend/` folder (if you chose Frontend or Full-Stack)
  - `README.md` (this file, optionally updated with setup instructions)

### 2. Complete SUBMISSION.md
Fill out the provided `SUBMISSION.md` template file in the root directory with:

- Track chosen (Backend/Frontend/Full-Stack)
- GitHub Copilot usage summary
- Key prompts used
- Design decisions and reasoning
- Challenges faced (optional)
- Time breakdown (optional)
- Optional challenge attempted (if any)

**The template file is already in the repository - just fill it out!**

### 3. Session Recording (Mandatory)

**Recording Method:**
- Create a **Microsoft Teams meeting** with your Reporting Manager (RM) and Technical Manager (TM)
- Start the meeting and begin screen sharing
- **Screen sharing must be of your entire screen** (not just a single window)
- Record the entire 60-minute session through MS Teams recording feature
- Ensure the recording captures:
  - Your full coding session
  - AI prompts used (visible in your IDE)
  - Code writing and testing process
  - Terminal output and browser testing
  - Verbal explanations of your approach

**Recording Guidelines:**
- Test your screen sharing and recording setup before starting
- Ensure audio isEnabled for verbal communication
- Keep camera On (optional but recommended)
- Recording will be stored in MS Teams and accessible to evaluators

### 4. Submit
Provide the following to your RM/TM:
- **GitHub repository URL**
- **MS Teams recording link** (will be available in the meeting chat after recording ends)
